<h3 style="color:blue;font-family:roboto">When Invented?</h3> <p style="font-family:cursive">The origins of the game can be traced back to the earliest civilizations of the world, but the modern game of field hockey was developed in the British Isles. The modern game was started in England in the mid 1800's and the first formal field hockey club the 'Blackheath Football and Hockey Club' was formed in 1861.

<h3 style="color:blue;font-family:roboto">Who Invented?</h3>
<p style="font-family:cursive">
The origins of field hockey can be traced to ancient Egypt, Persia, and Greece; but the game as we know it, was developed in the British Isles in the late 19th century. In 1901, field hockey was brought to the United States by an English woman, Constance M.K. Applebee.</p>

       <h3 style="color:blue; font-family:roboto"> Equipment Needed to Play</h3> 
       <p style="font-family:cursive">Mouthguards and throat protectors usually are required too. Leg and foot protection. Goalies should wear padded goalie pants, pelvic protectors, leg guards that fully cover the lower legs and allow freedom of movement, and the correct size kickers (foam guards that go over the cleats). Upper body and arm protection.</p>   

       <h3 style="color:blue; font-family:roboto">Most Popular</h3>
       <p style="font-family:cursive">The American game is regionally centered. The most intense support and popularity extends from Massachusetts down the Eastern seaboard to Virginia and pretty much stops there. The best programs tend to be in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, though states like Maryland and Delaware are slowing growing field hockey prowess.</p>
